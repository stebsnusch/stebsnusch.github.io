Message me on LinkedIn or send an email.\nHow to get started in programming? Do you need a degree? I started in college, but you don‚Äôt necessarily have to do the same. There are resources all over the internet that can make you a market-ready developer. However, college helped my professional experience in some ways:\n I‚Äôve learned about areas of tech that don‚Äôt necessarily need programming: you can be a project manager, build hardware, work with testing, research, audit systems, and a bunch of other things. It opened doors for me to find an internship very easily: if you still don‚Äôt know which ‚Äúarea within the area‚Äù of tech you want to pursue, internships are great opportunities to try everything.  In practice, you don‚Äôt need a degree to act as a developer, but this path can present you with a wide range of possibilities. It is important to remember that nowadays, although most companies no longer require a degree, some still do, especially if you intend to immigrate to another country, this can give you an advantage when being chosen.\nSearch properly! And remember: it‚Äôs okay if it doesn‚Äôt work. There are very good companies (!) that won‚Äôt demand a degree from you. I know amazing professionals who don‚Äôt have higher education.\nHow do I get my first job in tech? There are several ways. In my personal experience, it was through an internship. The first tip I can give you is that you create a resume that can convey your professional history and reflect your achievements.\nCreating projects on Github can also work very well: in addition to demonstrating your skills in a language, you also end up showing an understanding of version control tools, as you‚Äôll need to use Git to upload code to your repositories, and that‚Äôs something that many companies use these days.\nKeep your LinkedIn up to date, add people from the field, including recruiters. Most of the approaches I get happen over there! Follow developer communities and company profiles that you are interested in.\nDo interview! If any company calls you, even if you‚Äôre not confident, I believe it‚Äôs worth it. It was by doing this, and hearing many ‚Äúno‚Äôs‚Äù, that I understood the dynamics of the interviews and gained experience. Chatting costs nothing. If possible, ask the recruiter for feedback after the process and invest in areas where you need to improve.\nMaybe you‚Äôve followed all these tips and still didn‚Äôt make it. But don‚Äôt give up, some things take time. Know when to stop and when to insist. The job market can be cruel and that‚Äôs why I like so much to participate in developer events to exchange experiences and meet people. Each story is unique and we often discover that we are not alone in a certain situation.\nCan you help me with my programming project? If you text me, I can give you some basic tips, but I can‚Äôt help in a deeper way than this.\nHow to get a job abroad? Study English and specialize in a certain technology. For a country to hire a foreigner in place of a native, it must have a reason. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find openings for beginners like that, but they might exist!\nSome interesting platforms that connect candidates to companies in different countries:\n Vanhack Relocate.me StackOverflow Jobs (search with the filter ‚Äúvisa sponsor‚Äù or ‚Äúoffers relocation‚Äù)  You can also always enter the company‚Äôs website directly and apply there. That‚Äôs how I got an opportunity at Microsoft Vancouver.\nWhat is it like to work for another country? It is very cool! I‚Äôve always had this dream, to be able to connect with people from different cultures. There are things I would never learn if I continued working for companies that only exist in Brazil. There are different demands. I‚Äôve always wanted to know what it would be like to work on a product that serves the entire world, how to develop something so that it works well for both Brazil and Japan, and Saudi Arabia?\nIt‚Äôs also challenging because we Brazilians have habits that are very particular to our culture, but all you need to do is have common sense and think about how to communicate clearly, and you can get through everything without complications. Still, I think I use a lot more memes than most people. üòÖ\nWhat is the best programming language to study? It depends a lot on what you like and the moment in the market. I specialize in Javascript because I like it, it‚Äôs the language that will enable me to develop for the internet, and it will probably be in demand for many years to come. Research the languages that are used for your purpose, take a look at the open positions at companies you admire.\nRelated links  Career Posts Posts on gender equality About me  Your question didn‚Äôt appear here?

<p>I started in college, but you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to do the same. There are resources all over the internet that can make you a market-ready developer. However, college helped my professional experience in some ways:</p>
