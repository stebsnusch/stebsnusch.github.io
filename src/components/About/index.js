        Hello, there. My name is Stephany (she/her), and I am a Brazilian Software Engineer, more specifically located in the city of SÃ£o Paulo.
        I graduated in the first semester of 2016 at FATEC Rubens Lara and have been collecting professional experience since then.

      <Typography align="justify" paragraph>
        I am passionate about coding and am always studying to learn something new and find ways to improve my skills.
        My goal is to broaden my possibilities as a professional and to challenge myself to look for the smartest solutions.
        I love learning and am widely open to every opportunity to evolve technically and personally.

        Diversity and inclusion are topics that hold my interest, and I value initiatives to decrease the current inequality in tech.
