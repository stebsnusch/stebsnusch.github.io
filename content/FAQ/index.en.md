I've gathered on this page some questions that I get frequently. I hope something here can help you!

## Hi, how are you?

I'm good. Thanks for asking!

## What's the best way to get in touch with you?

Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanynusch/) or send an [email](mailto:contact@stebs.dev).

## How to get started in programming? Do you need a degree?

I started in college, but you don't necessarily have to do the same. There are resources all over the internet that can make you a market-ready developer. However, college helped my professional experience in some ways:

1. **I've learned about areas of tech that don't necessarily need programming:** you can be a project manager, build hardware, work with testing, research, audit systems, and a bunch of other things.
2. **It opened doors for me to find an internship very easily:** if you still don't know which "area within the area" of tech you want to pursue, internships are great opportunities to try everything.

In practice, you don't _need_ a degree to act as a developer, but this path can present you with a wide range of possibilities. It is important to remember that nowadays, although most companies no longer require a degree, some still do, especially if you intend to immigrate to another country, this can give you an advantage when being chosen.

Search properly! And remember: **it's okay if it doesn't work**. There are very good companies (!) that won't demand a degree from you. I know amazing professionals who don't have higher education.

## How do I get my first job in tech?

There are several ways. In my personal experience, it was through an internship. The first tip I can give you is that you create a resume that can convey your professional history and reflect your achievements.

Creating projects on Github can also work very well: in addition to demonstrating your skills in a language, you also end up showing an understanding of version control tools, as you'll need to use Git to upload code to your repositories, and that's something that many companies use these days.

**Keep your LinkedIn up to date**, add people from the field, including recruiters. Most of the approaches I get happen over there! Follow developer communities and company profiles that you are interested in.

**Do interview!** If any company calls you, even if you're not confident, I believe it's worth it. It was by doing this, and hearing many "no's", that I understood the dynamics of the interviews and gained experience. Chatting costs nothing. If possible, ask the recruiter for feedback after the process and invest in areas where you need to improve.

Maybe you've followed all these tips and still didn't make it. But don't give up, some things take time. Know when to stop and when to insist. The job market can be cruel and that's why I like so much to participate in developer events to exchange experiences and meet people. Each story is unique and we often discover that we are not alone in a certain situation.

## Can you help me with my programming project?

If you text me, I can give you some basic tips, but I can't help in a deeper way than this.

## How to get a job abroad?

Study English and specialize in a certain technology. For a country to hire a foreigner in place of a native, it must have a reason. It's pretty hard to find openings for beginners like that, but they might exist!

Some interesting platforms that connect candidates to companies in different countries:
- [Vanhack](https://vanhack.com/)
- [Relocate.me](https://relocate.me/)
- [StackOverflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs) (search with the filter "visa sponsor" or "offers relocation")

You can also always enter the company's website directly and apply there. That's how I got an opportunity at Microsoft Vancouver.

## What is it like to work for another country?

It is very cool! I've always had this dream, to be able to connect with people from different cultures. There are things I would never learn if I continued working for companies that only exist in Brazil. There are different demands. I've always wanted to know what it would be like to work on a product that serves the entire world, how to develop something so that it works well for both Brazil and Japan, and Saudi Arabia?

It's also challenging because we Brazilians have habits that are very particular to our culture, but all you need to do is have common sense and think about how to communicate clearly, and you can get through everything without complications. Still, I think I use a lot more memes than most people. ðŸ˜…

## What is the best programming language to study?

It depends a lot on what you like and the moment in the market. I specialize in Javascript because I like it, it's the language that will enable me to develop for the internet, and it will probably be in demand for many years to come. Research the languages that are used for your purpose, take a look at the open positions at companies you admire.
