The fact that I'd end up working in tech came as no surprise to me nor to anyone who knew me. I've always been curious and enthusiastic about the infinite possibilities that a computer or video game presented. To create and learn is what moves me and, for sure, is what brought me here. However, I was definitely not ready for all the obstacles waiting for me in this journey.

## Unconscious biases

Nowadays it is practically impossible to get into a deep discussion on any topic without taking into account the baggage we carry from our social construction. During the formation of each individual, the environment that surrounds them influences the understanding of the concepts of right and wrong. The social roles we are expected to fulfill, the people we are expected to relate to, all influences our development as social beings.

Graduating in Systems Analysis and Development was not easy. Not only from a technical point of view, but for the whole set that was _being_ in that environment. Taking a general balance of my entire trajectory, I believe that the time in college was the hardest. For several factors. First, I was coming out of my teens, trying to find myself, to belong to some group. Second, because obviously, the classroom had many more men than women, as well as the faculty. And in third place, then yes, the technical challenges.

When you're constantly reminded with examples, images, and behavior that you don't belong there, it's hard to find reasons to continue. But I never really found myself doing anything else. I knew this was what I wanted. But I also entered a moment of intense self-sabotage, allowing myself to be attacked on daily basis by all negative behavior that was driven towards me. My self-esteem was absurdly low, and it would stay that way for a while.

## Being responsible for your own growth

Going through difficult times is not easy. Embracing loneliness and allowing yourself to feel sadness, abandonment, and weakness is necessary. These are all valid feelings. We need to be willing to embrace our vulnerability so that we can begin our healing process. As hard as that was for me, I accepted the fact that I needed help.

I usually say that my life has two very important turning points: 1) when I discovered Avenged Sevenfold (my favorite band) and 2) when I started therapy. Let's talk about that last one now.

It was a very lucky stroke to find a good therapist on the first try. After panning through some feminist groups on Facebook, I found a woman offering therapy, and she focused on image disorders. It felt perfect to me, and it was. It is noteworthy here that I also carried a process of acceptance of my own body at that time. So, in addition to doubting my intellectual capacity, I also questioned my physique.

**By taking responsibility for my feelings and needs, I took the reins of that moment and started a treatment that changed my life**. Since then, I recommend to everyone that they undergo therapy. The professional who accompanies me follows the phenomenological line, that is, the treatment revolves around phenomena, intentionality, and awareness. If you are also considering starting treatment, it is helpful to understand the practitioner's approach. What works for me might not work for you.

Over time, I started psychiatric treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which I was diagnosed with in early 2020. Today, I have also added yoga practice to my routine here at home, and I feel the benefits are clear both for me and for those who live with me.

Understanding and assuming your situation is the first step. Then decide what to do about it. Maybe doing nothing is right for your moment, maybe not. It's up to each of us to decide what's best. And that's why I decided to share my trajectory — maybe that's what's missing for you to act too.

## The role of companies

The work environment has always influenced my productivity. **I resigned more than once because I felt uncomfortable**. This has definitely impacted my productivity and, negatively, my professional development. But I needed to prioritize my health, my well-being, even to be able to achieve my goals.

It is well known that happier employees produce more. The old mentality that you only get results by being rude is not suitable for the 21st century. If we use globally recognized companies as an example - Google, Microsoft, Netflix, etc -, we will notice that the tendency is to adopt a culture where the employee feels comfortable, regardless of race, gender, nationality, disability, or any other particularity.

Unfortunately, with Brazil's economic situation in decline, many professionals are willing to work in toxic environments. After all, the bills do not stop coming. But it's very interesting for me to see how the emotional aspect of micro-management adept leaders overlaps the rational. A healthy environment produces more. There is no logic in disrespecting your employees. Even so, they are still out there.

> Therefore, I hope to contribute by sharing my knowledge so that other professionals can qualify and reach places that provide ideal conditions, taking into account the high demand of software developers like me.

## Day-to-day

The mental health of my colleagues became a constant point of attention for me. At one point, I found myself surrounded by brilliant people, and I wanted to get to know them, understand their processes, enrich my life a little more with their stories.

So I decided to adopt a somewhat risky role in the team I was on at the time, at QuintoAndar. During the retrospective meetings, I started teasing and making comments about my mental health at that time, giving those who also wanted to open up a chance. I believe it's important to signal when we're not at our best. This way, we avoid misjudgments about our work.

I also took the opportunity to expose impressions I had about the dynamics of our team. Sometimes they were right and we were able to act on potential discomforts.

With the help of my leader, I ended up becoming the person on the team who did this “overall assessment” of the team's atmosphere. I received very positive feedback about it, I was truly happy. No particular reason made me want to act that way. I simply cared about my colleagues. It wasn't unusual for us to create calendar events called “Gossip Time” and things like that. We were a very tight team and I am very proud of the work we did together. I wish every person who was with me there a lot of success. They are amazing professionals. And I feel sorry for companies that might let them go for "bad culture" reasons.

## The importance of communities

On September 7, 2019, I participated in the Progra{m}aria Summit. I have no words to describe how this event helped me to regain my professional self-esteem. I almost didn't go because there was no one to accompany me. But luckily, I was stubborn.

After attending lectures by female leaders at companies like Google and Oracle, I got to know incredible initiatives like The Girls on the Road, which earned me the reading of a sensational book, [“Own Our Own Terms”](https://www.amazon.com/Our-Own-Terms-Stories-entrepreneurs-ebook/dp/B07P5PNCDK/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=taciana+mello&qid=1551985321&s=gateway&sr=8-2-spell). During that day, I also participated in the speed hiring of some companies and ended up becoming part of Aceleradev, an initiative by QuintoAndar to increase the participation of women in its engineering area. That, then, would be the beginning of a crescent in my career.

It's cliché to say this, but it's true: you are unique. Your trajectory may not look like that of your colleagues. It could be that you are feeling lonely and lost right now. It's not easy being a woman in a patriarchal society. It was just a fluke to discover that employee happiness positively influences productivity. If it were the other way around, we would be lost.

I find myself constantly reflecting on what is within my reach, what kind of example I can set for more women with dreams similar to mine. Building my self-esteem and assuming to myself that I am an excellent professional was difficult. But that's the truth: I'm worth a lot, and my work is amazing.

My dream is to be able to sharpen this feeling in other girls and women. This was one of the reasons that led me to volunteer at [Brazilians in Tech](https://braziliansintech.com/). Much of our potential is hidden in the rubble of our traumas.
